# A sizeable chunk of time [during compilation] is spent in the linking
# phase - assembling the actual binary given the outputs of the

# The default linker does a good job, but there are faster alternatives
# depending on the operating system you are using

# On Linux:
# - Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install lld clang`
